# SUnWNS-TV: Papanicolaou stain Unmixing Using Nonnegativity, Weighted Nucleus Sparsity, and Total Variation Regularization

This repository contains the MATLAB implementation of the **SUnWNS_TV** algorithm, a stain unmixing method tailored for Papanicolaou-stained RGB images. The algorithm incorporates **nonnegativity**, **weighted nucleus norm sparsity**, and **total variation (TV)** to robustly decompose stain abundances of 4 dyes from RGB images.

## 🔍 Overview

**Key Features:**
- Converts RGB image to optical density (OD) using the Beer–Lambert law.
- Estimates stain abundance matrix under:
  - Nonnegativity constraint
  - Weighted nucleus sparsity promoting low-rank structure in each stain
  - Total variation for spatial smoothness
- Implements an **ADMM**-based optimization strategy for efficient convergence.
